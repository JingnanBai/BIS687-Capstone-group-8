class="c5 c8"><span class="c4">Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) ranks as the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder in the US, affecting nearly 90,000 individuals annually. Characterized by uncontrollable movements such as shaking, stiffness, and imbalance, PD significantly diminishes patients&rsquo; quality of life. Characterized as a progressive neurological disorder, PD occurs due to the gradual degeneration or death of nerve cells in the basal ganglia. The exact cause of neuronal death remains inconclusive, though current research suggests a combination of specific genetic variants and environmental factors, including toxin exposure, as leading risk contributors.</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c4">Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that develops over time as a result of nerve cells in the basal ganglia gradually degenerating or dying. Although the precise cause of neuronal death is still unknown, recent research points to a combination of toxin exposure and particular genetic variants as the main risk factors.</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c4">Due to the significant consequences of Parkinson&#39;s disease, our group has made the decision to look into the underlying characteristics and create a predictive model for an early diagnosis. This research plays a critical role in raising the standard of patient care by enabling medical professionals to create customized treatment regimens that improve patients&#39; quality of life.</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c4">Our research also aims to facilitate early detection, which can slow the progression of the disease and greatly increase the opportunities for intervention. Our research may help develop preventive public health initiatives by pinpointing particular lifestyle factors associated with Parkinson&#39;s, which could lower the overall incidence of Parkinson&#39;s disease. These initiatives demonstrate how crucially important our project is to improving Parkinson&#39;s disease patient care and medical knowledge.</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c3">SPECIFIC AIMS:</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c3">A. Specific Aim 1</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c4">Aim 1 of our study is to explore features distinguishing individuals with Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) from those without. This initial aim is crucial as it sets the foundation for developing effective diagnostic tools and interventions. By identifying specific characteristics or markers that are significantly associated with Parkinson&#39;s disease, we can enhance our understanding of its pathophysiology and possibly find new targets for treatment intervention.</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c3">B. Specific Aim 2</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c4">Aim 2 of our study is to develop a predictive model for the early diagnosis of Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) using a wealth of physiological, lifestyle, and demographic data from the UK Biobank. This goal involves investigating participant data on their trunks and limbs among other things in order to create a model that can accurately predict the onset of Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) in its early stages.</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">RESEARCH STRATEGY</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">A. Significance</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Data analysis related to Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) is crucial for improving our knowledge of this severe neurodegenerative condition. Researchers can find subtle patterns and correlations between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that influence the development and progression of Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) by carefully examining data related to the disease. The development of predictive models that can identify people at increased risk much earlier than is currently feasible will require this deeper understanding. The management of Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) depends heavily on early detection because it enables the implementation of interventions that may significantly alter the course of the disease, possibly delaying the beginning of severe symptoms and extending patient independence.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">In addition, the examination of Parkinson&#39;s disease data makes it easier to identify particular biomarkers that can be used for both continuous disease monitoring and early detection. This ability increases the efficacy of therapeutic interventions by enabling more precise modification of treatment plans to meet the specific requirements of patients. Furthermore, information gathered from PD data analysis plays an essential part in illuminating the basic processes underlying Parkinson&#39;s disease. This information is essential for the creation of novel remedies and treatments that concentrate on these fundamental mechanisms.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">B. Innovation</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Because of the skewed nature of our dataset&mdash;in which the number of healthy individuals is significantly greater than that of PD patients&mdash;our research on Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) presents a special set of challenges. This imbalance may result in skewed analyses and less reliable findings. In order to creatively address this problem, our research makes use of multiple advanced methods to efficiently balance the dataset. To create synthetic data, we use techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), undersampling the control group, and oversampling PD cases. By assisting in the normalization of the dataset distribution, these methods improve the precision and representativeness of our analysis concerning the actual effects of Parkinson&#39;s disease. Our diligent approach to settle this imbalance strengthens the basis for PD research going forward, guaranteeing that the knowledge acquired is legitimate and applicable.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">C. Research Plan</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Our research on Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) is structured into a four-step plan designed for maximum efficiency and clarity, ensuring a thorough investigation into the complexities of PD.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Step 1: Data Processing</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">The initial stage of our research involves addressing the inherent imbalance within our dataset, a common challenge in medical research. We apply techniques such as WOE and NMS algorithm for oversampling and strategic undersampling to ensure a fair representation of PD cases and controls. This step is crucial as it lays a bias-free foundation for all subsequent analyses.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">During the EDA phase, we delve into the dataset to extract preliminary insights and identify potential predictors of PD. This important stage directs the course of our more in-depth research and aids in our understanding of the data&#39;s underlying structure. At this point, we start to formulate theories regarding the connections between the data that might be relevant to Parkinson&#39;s disease.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Step 3: Analysis of Feature Importance</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">We use complex algorithms to perform a feature importance analysis after EDA. This is an important step because it establishes which factors have greatest impacts on the likelihood of getting Parkinson&#39;s disease. By evaluating the relative significance and causal connections between these characteristics, we are able to better understand the complex nature of Parkinson&#39;s disease. The knowledge acquired here is crucial for later phases, enabling targeted and knowledgeable model development.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Step 4: Model Building and Evaluation</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">The final stage involves constructing predictive models using techniques such as Logistic Regression, Linear Mixed-effects Model, Propensity Score Matching and Random Forest. &nbsp;We carefully evaluate these models to make sure they are able to reliably predict PD risk and demonstrate good generalization across a wide range of populations. This comprehensive evaluation procedure is necessary to confirm that our models are accurate.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">This research plan enables us to approach Parkinson&#39;s disease data with precision, from initial data correction to advanced model development. Our objective is to uncover deep understanding into the factors that predict Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) and to offer strong frameworks for managing and predicting the disease by carefully navigating these steps.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">D. Specific Aim 1: To explore features distinguishing people with and without PD.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">D.1 Hypothesis</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Patient demographics (age, gender, ethnicity), diet (specific dietary patterns or nutritional intake), and habits (exercise frequency, tobacco use, alcohol intake) can significantly affect the occurrence of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">D.2 Rationale</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">The emphasis on these factors is due to the multifactorial nature of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, which involves complex interactions between genetic predisposition and environmental exposures. In previous clinical research, it has been established that specific dietary components such as antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables can reduce oxidative stress, which is crucial in the neurodegenerative process observed in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. While these results provide valuable information on protective dietary elements, a key question that remains in our understanding is how broader lifestyle patterns, including exercise, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption, interact with dietary habits and demographic backgrounds to influence the risk of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">D.3 Challenge and Assumptions</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">The UK Biobank data collection occurred in four waves: initially between 2006 and 2010, followed by subsequent collections in 2012, 2014, and 2019. The reporting dates for PD in our dataset range from 1981 to 2021, with a median year of 2017. This temporal framework facilitates longitudinal analysis but complicates aligning PD report dates with the data collection phases. To address this, we separated the PD patients into two cohorts based on their PD diagnosis status at baseline for separate analyses: </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c26 lst-kix_ekq1jz7nrfqm-0 start"><li class="c5 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Cohort 1: participants who were not diagnosed with PD at baseline but received a diagnosis in subsequent follow-ups. We compared their baseline characteristics with those of individuals without PD to identify potential risk factors or early indicators of PD.</span></li><li class="c5 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Cohort 2: patients who have already been diagnosed with PD at baseline and four instances were documented after the PD report. This cohort allows us to examine the progression of PD and its impact on quality of life over time.</span></li></ul><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Considering all the background information, our analysis incorporated a few assumptions. For example, we assumed that the PD diagnosis time is accurate relative to the onset of noticeable symptoms. That is, individuals with similar symptom severity are diagnosed within a comparable timeframe. We also assumed that the intervals between the 4 recorded instances are comparable, disregarding various time differences.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c18">D.4 Task</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;1 - Investigate key baseline characteristics prior to PD onset</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">D.4.1 Participant and Feature Selection</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">From the entire dataset comprising 1294 features across 96,512 participants, 463 were diagnosed with PD. For Cohort 1, we selected 360 participants who developed PD post-baseline, and matched the patients with 360 healthy individuals using propensity score matching. This matching was based on four demographic factors: age, sex, ethnicity, and Townsend Deprivation Index. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">From the initial 1,296 variables, we focused on 468 that were recorded at baseline. Then, 201 of the 468 variables were retained, after removing variables with a missing rate exceeding 20%, high correlations, and categorical variables with near zero variance. These were then analyzed using forward stepwise selection to pinpoint critical variables related to PD onset.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c17"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 538.50px; height: 247.68px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 538.50px; height: 247.68px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">D.4.2 Logistic Regression</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Logistic regression was employed to assess the odds ratio of PD onset given various baseline characteristics. To retain information at a maximized level, MICE algorithm was used to impute missing data. The final model, refined through forward stepwise selection, highlighted 46 variables, with 20 showing statistical significance.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">D.4.2 Interpretation of Results</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">The significant variables fell into three categories: physical activity (measured via accelerometers), lifestyle, and mental health. Notably, the odds of PD are higher among participants who were observed with lower average acceleration, with statistically significant measures clustered in the afternoon. This coincides with the odds ratio modeled for walking pace that participants with slow pace at baseline are much more likely to suffer from PD than those with steady average pace or brisk pace. Regarding life habits, it was noticed that the odds of PD are higher among participants with the following characteristics: insomnia, less dried fruit intake, more water intake, and major dietary changes in the last 5 years. Interestingly, longer sleep durations correlated with lower PD risk, potentially indicating issues like poor sleep quality and sleep fragmentation. &nbsp;In addition, sensitivity or hurt feelings also emerged as significant factors for PD onset. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">In conclusion, our modeling results generally align with existing literature, suggesting that decreased physical activity, irregular or unhealthy dietary habits, insomnia, and mental health challenges could serve as potential PD risk factors or early indicators. These characteristics were statistically significant in distinguishing between healthy individuals and those who would later develop PD.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">D.4.3 Limitations</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Our study&#39;s analytical model presents several limitations that may impact the interpretation and generalizability of the findings. Primarily, our use of logistic regression assumes linear relationships between the predictors and the log odds of developing Parkinson&#39;s disease, potentially overlooking nonlinear interactions such as quadratic or interaction effects that might better explain the data. Alternative feature selection methods like Lasso or Elastic Net, which provide regularization to manage multicollinearity and reduce the risk of overfitting, were not employed but could potentially enhance the robustness of our model. Moreover, the absence of data on other comorbidities such as diabetes or anemia presents a significant limitation. These conditions might confound the relationships between identified risk factors and Parkinson&#39;s disease, as they may independently or synergistically influence PD symptom manifestation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">D.5 Task 2 - Analyze longitudinal trends following PD diagnosis</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">D.5.1 Participant and Feature Selection</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Similarly, we began with the full dataset comprising 96,512 participants and 1,294 features. Of these, 92 participants, out of 463 with PD, had 4 instances recorded after PD reporting, while 96,049 participants had no such diagnosis. The low prevalence of PD in our dataset presented a significant challenge due to data imbalance. To address this issue, we applied propensity score matching, selecting a subset of non-PD samples that closely matched the demographic profiles (age, sex, ethnicity, and Townsend index for socioeconomic status) of PD patients. This process resulted in a balanced cohort of 184 participants, half diagnosed with PD.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">In the next stage of our analysis, we focused on refining feature selection. We limited our feature set to those that are numeric and have records across all 4 instances. It is important to note that there were still some missing values within these 4 instances. This approach helped us identify 81 unique features, each consistently recorded across four instances, in addition to the 4 demographic features used in our matching process.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c17"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 398.20px; height: 149.96px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 398.20px; height: 149.96px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">D.5.2 Linear Mixed-effects Model</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">We used linear mixed-effects models (nlme) to assess the differences in the trends between the group with and without PD. The 4 demographic variables (age, sex, ethnicity, and Townsend index) was controlled as fixed effects, participant eid was treated as a random effect, and a quadratic spline was applied to the time component. We conducted likelihood ratio tests to evaluate if the average trend and the interaction between the group and time were significantly different. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">D.5.3 Results</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">In the left panel, we retain numeric features that are significant either at baseline or through interaction effects. We observe significant differences between the PD and non-PD groups in terms of baseline for time spent using the computer, sleep duration, longest period of depression, and average weekly red wine intake. Additionally, the interaction over time for computer usage, sitting height, and average weekly fortified wine intake shows significant differences between the two groups. In the right panel, we visualized the longitudinal trends across 4 instances for some selected significant features.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 334.18px; height: 220.80px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 334.18px; height: 220.80px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 220.80px; height: 220.80px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 220.80px; height: 220.80px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">D.5.4 Limitations</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">First, there is still a high level of missingness in our small cohort, which could compromise the accuracy of our model fit. Missing values, which may stem from refusal to answer, lack of knowledge, or non-collection, might be disproportionately distributed across PD and non-PD groups and introduce bias. Second, our current methodology does not allow us to examine the collective association between the features of interest within a single model. A potential direction for future research could be to incorporate methods that address this limitation of association.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">E. Specific Aim 2: Building practical and interpretable models for predicting the risk of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease for each specific patient.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">E.1 Hypothesis</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">While no definitive cause has been identified in previous studies, Parkinson&#39;s disease is widely believed to be associated with a combination of various risk factors, including basic demographic information, environmental risk factors, lifestyle, and family history of related syndromes. Based on preliminary studies and recognized literature conclusions, we believe that predicting the risk of Parkinson&#39;s disease, which would significantly contribute to the early detection of the disease, is both feasible and practical.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">For aim 2, we will focus on building a predictive model for each specific patient to estimate the risk of Parkinson&#39;s disease at an individual level. During this part, we will explore more complex machine learning methods that differ from traditional statistical models, while ensuring the simplicity and interpretability of the prediction process. Furthermore, based on the interpretable trained model, we will also explore additional indicators that may not be causative but could still assist in the early diagnosis of Parkinson&#39;s disease, further verifying and supplementing our conclusions from aim 1.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">E.2 Rationale</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c18">Contribute to Early Detection</span><span class="c4">: Build a predictive model to estimate the risk of Parkinson&#39;s disease is crucial for early detection and treatment of the disease. On the one hand, early treatment can help control the progression of the disease, leading to an improvement in long-term life quality; On the other hand, Parkinson&#39;s disease is associated with various complications such as postural instability, motor impairments, and cognitive impairment. Early detection of the disease could significantly reduce the risk introduced by these complications.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c18">Practical and Cost-efficient</span><span class="c4">: Although genetic factors are recognized as a crucial component of early Parkinson&#39;s diagnosis, conducting tests for certain genetic mutations always increase the complexity and cost of detection, making it impractical in wide use. Based on that, we will not include features related to genetics for aim 2, differing from various previous studies. Instead, we will focus on achieving more accurate predictions using other features that are easier to detect and collect. Additionally, we will also pay attention to the balance between the model performance and the simplicity of the data processing and modeling, aiming at building a practical, cost-efficient and widely applicable model for risk estimation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c18">Provide Insights for Risk Factors</span><span class="c4">: In contrast to aim 1, aim 2 will involve modeling the relationship between features and the risk of Parkinson&#39;s disease using more complex tree-based methods. &nbsp;While ensuring the interpretability, we will also explore various preprocessing techniques for the original variables, including WOE binning, information value and NMS algorithm for mitigating collinearity. With a processing structure different from traditional statistical methods, models here will provide special insights into the potential risk factors associated with Parkinson&#39;s disease and further validate the conclusions drawn in aim 1.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">E.3 Experimental approach</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">1. Basic Data Preparation</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Basic data preparation would be conducted first to ensure data quality:</span></p><ol class="c26 lst-kix_55ixzu6lp6p2-0 start" start="1"><li class="c5 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Data cleaning: keep cases which are diagnosed after enrollment (incident cases)&#65292;and if an instance has multiple measurement results, compute the average value. Also, compute the difference between each measurement and the previous one (first-order differencing) to reduce the influence of unexpected fluctuations.</span></li><li class="c5 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Remove columns with missing proportions exceeding 80%: Features with high proportion of missing may not be adequately represented in the minority class, while imputation will introduce significant bias and make the modeling even more challenging.</span></li><li class="c5 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Drop features with approximately constant values: For categorical variables, assess the proportion of different levels. If a single level accounts for over 99% of the samples, it may lack significant discriminative ability and can be dropped.</span></li></ol><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">2. WOE + information value for feature filtering</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">WOE (weight of evidence) is a supervised coding method which is commonly used in financial risk models. With tree-based binning, WOE values could be calculated for each group to represent the difference between &quot;the proportion of the target customers in the current group to all target customers&quot; and &quot;the proportion of non-target customers in the current group to all non-target customers&quot;:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c17"><img src="images/image1.png"></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Based on the WOE values for each bin, we can calculate the Information Value (IV) as a measure of feature importance:</span></p><p class="c17"><img src="images/image2.png"></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">For aim 2, IV is used as feature filtering, in which we set the threshold of IV to 0.1 and discard any features with an IV lower than this threshold. Binning the numerical variable helps the tree-based model converge more efficiently when finding the optimal splitting value, making it a suitable feature engineering method based on the characteristics of our predictive model (random forest); Moreover, it contributes significantly to reducing the model&#39;s complexity as a feature filter, while also plays a crucial role in other feature engineering process, such as dealing with collinearity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">3. NMS algorithm for collinearity problem</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Given the large number of features in the original dataset (1295), severe collinearity poses a significant challenge to further modeling and increases the time required to identify an optimal subset of features. We employ the Non-Max Suppression (NMS) algorithm as a basic solution structure for collinearity. This algorithm, commonly used in computer vision, selects a sub-optimal subset of features as follows:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><ol class="c26 lst-kix_8m3pgxhjfstw-0 start" start="1"><li class="c5 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Assume the original feature set as A&#8203;.</span></li><li class="c5 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Select the feature with the highest feature importance (information value) and add it to the final feature set S.</span></li><li class="c5 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Calculate the correlation of the chosen feature with every other remaining feature in $A$. Remove features with a correlation higher than a threshold (0.8) from A as redundancy.</span></li><li class="c5 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Select the feature with the second-highest feature importance among the remaining features in $A$, add it to the final feature set S, and repeat the steps above.</span></li><li class="c5 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Repeat the process until the remaining feature set A is empty.</span></li></ol><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">With the NMS algorithm, we identified and dropped about 13% redundant variables highly collinear with other more important features. In model comparison, we will further validate the effectiveness of the NMS method, as models with collinearity processing perform better than the original one in terms of recall.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">4. Propensity Score Matching</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Due to the low prevalence of Parkinson&#39;s disease within the population, we are facing a severe data imbalance problem when building a classification model. Traditional solutions for imbalance include subsampling and generating new data with methods such as SMOTE. However, considering the characteristics of our dataset, subsampling may result in unacceptable information loss, while generating new data could make the classification boundary even more ambiguous. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Given these considerations, propensity score matching (PSM) would be used for addressing the imbalance problem. PSM aims to identify a subset among non-diseased samples that is most similar to the patients with Parkinson&#39;s. We believe that it could help construct a dataset that is more concentrated around the classification boundary, which would significantly contribute to the model in learning and characterizing sample features effectively.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">5. Predictive Model with Random Forest</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">With the matched data, random forest would be used for building the predictive model. As a tree-based model with bagging structure, random forest strikes a good balance between model performance and complexity. While utilizing nonlinear meta-learners (in this case, CART trees) to fit the data, it effectively controls potential variance through ensemble learning at the same time, which helps mitigate the risk of overfitting.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">We conduct model evaluation with 10-fold cross validation to assess the model performance. Meanwhile, several further experiments for model comparisons are conducted to further validate the previous feature engineering processes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">E.4 Result</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">The data processing and model construction methods have been outlined above. Using 742 samples (371 incident cases and 371 matched non-Parkinson&#39;s</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">samples) and 221 features, the following statistical analyses were conducted in R 4.2.2.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">The model performance, assessed with 10-fold cross-validation, is as follows:</span></p><a id="t.341b991e48260cb50559114d4ea21df4350b70ea"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c13"><tr class="c22"><td class="c29" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">recall</span></p></td><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">AUC</span></p></td><td class="c10" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">accuracy</span></p></td><td class="c16" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">F1-score</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c22"><td class="c29" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">0.562</span></p></td><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">0.546</span></p></td><td class="c10" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">0.501</span></p></td><td class="c16" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">0.517</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c5"><span class="c4">From the results above, the recall reaches 0.562 with an AUC of approximately 0.546. Recall is considered a more crucial indicator here because missing patients with a high risk of Parkinson&#39;s could lead to significant consequences.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">On the one hand, diagnosing Parkinson&#39;s disease remains challenging based on preliminary studies. On the other hand, due to the utilization of propensity score matching, our model is built on a subset of the dataset that represents the most challenging scenarios (a subset of non-disease samples that are closest to the classification boundary). We believe that the model&#39;s performance is acceptable under these considerations.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of the previous feature engineering process, we conducted a series of experiments using different model settings for comparison.The baseline setting refers to using the original dataset without feature filtering but with imputation for missing values. The second setting, denoted as &quot;+IV,&quot; represents the model with data after information value (IV) filtering but without collinearity processing (NMS algorithm). The third setting, labeled as &quot;+IV + NMS,&quot; reflects the final model setting described in the experimental approach section. All comparisons are based on the recall score from 10-fold cross-validation. The results of the model comparison are as follows:</span></p><a id="t.ef4c7a7e4a708e9e00009384306016a6f764e142"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c13"><tr class="c22"><td class="c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Baseline</span></p></td><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">+ IV</span></p></td><td class="c24" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">+IV + NMS</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c22"><td class="c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">recall</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">0.487</span></p></td><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">0.504</span></p></td><td class="c24" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">0.562</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c5"><span class="c4">The final model setting, which incorporates both IV filtering (with WOE binning) and collinearity processing (NMS algorithm), achieved the highest score in terms of recall. This demonstrates that these feature engineering techniques are effective in improving the model performance.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">E.5 interpretation and potential limitation</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4">Based on the feature importance calculated by the tree-based model (based on average Gini score), physical activity measurements are a crucial factor for the early detection of Parkinson&#39;s disease. As abnormalities of movement are widely recognized as a preliminary indicator of Parkinson&#39;s, related factors such as average acceleration may significantly contribute to classification. Additionally, indicators of muscle condition, such as leg fat-free mass and arm fat-free mass, are also crucial factors. These insights align with our conclusion from aim 1.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4">Our methods for aim 2 have several potential limitations: Firstly, due to the extreme data imbalance, the sample size of Parkinson&#39;s disease patients is relatively small (371 cases), making it challenging to conduct further assessment of the model robustness. Secondly, missing values are processed using WOE methods, either combined with specific bins or set as a new single bin, which lacks adequate interpretability and validation. Additionally, the process for identifying redundant variables is somewhat rough, and the final model still exhibits some collinearity issues. The NMS algorithm used for collinearity reduction is greedy and may result in suboptimal outcomes. Although the random forest predictive model is not highly sensitive to collinearity, further improvements could be made with more detailed data preprocessing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Conclusion:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">In the analysis of data pertaining to Parkinson&#39;s disease, several primary factors significantly impacting the likelihood of disease development have been identified. These factors include sleep disorders, feelings of nervousness, a slow walking pace, and chest pain. Crucial numeric features that have demonstrated significant differences at baseline or through interaction effects, such as time spent using a computer, sleep duration, the longest period of depression, and average weekly red wine intake, were retained in our study. Furthermore, interaction effects over time were notably significant for features like computer usage, sitting height, and fortified wine intake, differentiating between Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) and non-PD groups.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">These results have been further supported by visualizations of longitudinal trends for a subset of significant features over four instances. Physical activity measurements, in particular abnormalities in movement such as average acceleration and muscle condition indicators like leg and arm fat-free mass, were highlighted by the tree-based model&#39;s feature importance analysis as being crucial for the early diagnosis of Parkinson&#39;s disease. These measures are consistent with established early markers of Parkinson&#39;s disease, highlighting their importance in the categorization of the illness.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">However, several limitations were encountered in our methodological approach. The small sample size of PD patients due to data imbalance poses challenges in assessing the robustness of our models. Furthermore, the elimination of redundant variables and the application of Weight of Evidence (WOE) techniques to handle missing values lacked rigorous validation, which resulted in residual collinearity in the model. It is impossible to rule out the possibility of less-than-ideal results, even when the NMS algorithm is used to reduce collinearity. The random forest model&#39;s insensitivity to collinearity is advantageous, but it could perform better with more thorough data preprocessing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">In conclusion, this study illustrates the complex nature of diagnosing Parkinson&#39;s disease, emphasizing both the important markers and the methodological nuances of predictive modeling. To confirm these preliminary results and improve predictive accuracy, more research should focus on improving these techniques and growing the dataset.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">References:</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c21"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.
